Web 3; that’s the movement trying to develop a new generation of the internet beyond the platform economy with decentralization in mind and democratization in the heart. This is good, this is necessary (I might describe why in a separate article). But currently the movement is driven by the wrong people. You recognize them by their euphoria about blockchain and it’s first application: Cryptocurrencies. In the following article I want to describe why we shouldn’t listen to those people that much and why we should change our minds regarding what Web3 could be. Let’s go!

### Blockchain is great but…
The blockchain was an amazing invention and the completion of an initial implementation of it so shortly after publishing the theory was also a phenomenal accomplishment. However, I don’t think it’s the universal solution for all problems. It’s rather a very good solution, but for a very narrow problem space.

Let’s give a short demonstration of why blockchain is possibly not the best solution for a truly decentralized and democratic internet. I won’t take proof-of-work into account since it’s an obviously flawed idea, so let’s look at how I could start participating in a different blockchain. If I want to be a “staker” in a blockchain-infrastructure like Ethereum today I first need to accumulate a lot of ETH, to be precise: 32 ETH. At the time of writing this is equivalent to 129534,08 US-$. That’s a shocker, but let’s just assume for a second here, we have that money. Now let’s setup a miner. First, we need to do a full sync of the whole Ethereum blockchain, this is a lot of data, to be precise just over 1 TB (at the time of writing). According to the Ethereum guidelines this should also be an SSD drive. For the rest of the hardware requirements, I will follow what Lighthouse says.  With those requirements I researched we need a rig that costs about 400$. Apart from the price of the Ethereum (which could plummet in value) even this is not something everyone could easily afford.

Apart from the hardware prices there is also another inherent flaw: With staking rich people can develop a “passive income” and get richer by default. It is very questionable if we want something like that baked into the internet we try to free from the giant corporate players.

Today it’s very common for some more valuable crypto products to run blockchains in an isolated way so that not everyone could just participate, that’s obviously counterproductive and shouldn’t be considered Web3. Examples for that would be Diem (by Meta) or “The Internet Computer”. The latter is also a very excellent example for the misuse of blockchain. ICP stores (by protocol) the canisters in a blockchain, executing the logic from there. The question that comes to mind: But why?

I think the best explanation why everything web3 throws itself on blockchain is money. Impressed by the crypto-boom a lot of venture capitalists like to invest in start-ups with something blockchain connected to it. However, I don’t think this is good for technological development in web3.

In the past we have seen Web3 projects developing very sophisticated systems without blockchains. A very good example is I2P, but not the only one.

Blockchains are inefficient. They have a slim use case; we should stop overusing them.

### Crypto bros are bad…

Because they don’t really care. In classic media the crypto boom is always described as a “gold rush”. I think that’s a good characterization. Because the bubble that is building around these coins is just interested in the financial gain from buying and selling crypto, not in a transformation of the internet. If you have any doubts about that, just look at Dodge coin. Dodge coin doesn’t promote a new technology or at least an innovative company. No. It's just a meme. A very valuable meme. Dodgecoin is the cryptocurrency with the 11th highest market cap (according to coinmarketcap) with 23 Bio. US-$. The interest of becoming rich was the driver for web2 and it promotes the platform economy. The foundation for a new internet should be created without an intend to cash out.

### What Web3 should be
Honestly? I don’t know. We must keep on doing research in this field. I think the folks over at Protocol Labs are on a good path towards building a good foundational infrastructure. IPFS and Libp2p are great projects (I’ve used them myself), I’m not certain yet what to think of Filecoin. ICP was a good idea either, just badly made. Blockchain is not the ultimate solution.

We must keep on innovating!
